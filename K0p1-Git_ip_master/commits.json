Rename, Greet, Exit","messageBody":"Rename Duke to ChattyBot across code and documentation\n\nThe bot has been renamed from Duke to ChattyBot to better reflect its\npurpose and provide a more user-friendly identity.\n\nThis change includes:\n- Updating the class name from Duke to ChattyBot\n- Renaming references in documentation and comments\n- Ensuring consistency in usage across the codebase\n\nThis unification prevents confusion between the old and new names and\naligns both the code and the docs under the updated ChattyBot branding.\n","tags":["Level-0"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":10,"deletions":10},"bat":{"insertions":1,"deletions":1},"md":{"insertions":3,"deletions":3}}},{"hash":"cdc6957e0e9aecc6c5742d5656892eb3aafc9982","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Level 1. Echo","messageBody":"Implement Level 1: Echo functionality\n\nExtend the skeletal version of ChattyBot to support basic interaction\nwith the user. The bot now echoes any command entered by the user,\nproviding immediate feedback in a consistent response format.\n\nAdditionally, the bot terminates gracefully when the user enters the\n\"bye\" command, displaying a farewell message before exiting.\n\nThis change establishes the foundational input/output loop upon which\nsubsequent features (such as task management) can be built.\n","tags":["Level-1"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":23,"deletions":4}}},{"hash":"e0fed1624501e63a807aadb7f006a07c90c7b2fc","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Level 2. Add, List","messageBody":"Refactor task storage to use ArrayList\n\nReplace the fixed-size String array with an ArrayList for storing tasks.\nThis removes the artificial limit of 100 tasks and eliminates the need\nto manually track the task count.\n\nUsing ArrayList simplifies task management and provides greater\nflexibility for future enhancements, such as task deletion or marking\ntasks as completed.\n","tags":["Level-2"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":13,"deletions":4}}},{"hash":"8d0ec85bf5beeca462c6c741bdb66937f8a611ff","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Level 3. Mark as Done","messageBody":"Implement Level 3: Mark and Unmark with Task class\n\nIntroduce a Task class to represent individual tasks with a description\nand completion status. ChattyBot now supports marking tasks as done and\nreverting them back to not done via the \"mark N\" and \"unmark N\"\ncommands, respectively.\n\nThe in-memory task list has been migrated from plain strings to\nArrayList\u003cTask\u003e, enabling clearer modeling of task state and easier\nextensibility for future features.\n\nThe \"list\" command now prints each task with a status icon:\n[X] for completed tasks and [ ] for pending tasks, matching the\nexpected output format.\n","tags":["Level-3"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":72,"deletions":12}}},{"hash":"2126fd76213f6e008a2f91da935694d8a4a2e19f","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Level 4. ToDos, Events, Deadlines","messageBody":"Implement Level 4: ToDos, Deadlines, and Events (A-Inheritance)\n\nIntroduce task subtypes Todo, Deadline, and Event that inherit from the\nbase Task class.

The \"list\"\ncommand shows each task prefixed with its type ([T]/[D]/[E]) and status\n([ ] or [X]), matching the required output format. Dates/times are\ntreated as plain strings at this stage.\n\nThis change lays the groundwork for future enhancements such as date\nparsing, persistence, and richer task operations.\n","tags":["Level-4"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":117,"deletions":6}}},{"hash":"0daac10ce18a4dc98062c659cb9d7f7f755aa120","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Level 5.
