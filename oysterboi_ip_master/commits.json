error handling via Exceptions","messageBody":"Error handling is currently hard-coded.\n\nProper error handling will make the code more structured and easier to\nupdate when more features are added and more possible errors arise.\n\nError handling lets us inform the user what went wrong with their\ninputs and helps them to figure out how to use the app properly.\n\nWe can streamline error handling using Exceptions, which allows us to\ncatch exceptions that occur at any point throughout the

principles helps to compartmentalise\nlogic, creating a codebase that is easier to expand and evolve. Using\npackages also helps us to keep files organised as well.\n\nThe enum variables have also been replaced with the Command class and\nits respective subclasses, each corresponding to a possible command in\nthe program. Using an abstract Command class allows to generalise our\nexecution and allow polymorphism to ensure that the correct logic gets\nrun for each specific command.\n\nThis is done to ensure that our codebase is expandable as we add more\nfeatures and more lines of code.\n","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"txt":{"insertions":10,"deletions":2},"java":{"insertions":562,"deletions":248}}}]}]},"authorFileTypeContributionMap":{"oysterboi":{"java":680,"md":3,"fxml":0,"sh":0,"bat":1,"gradle":0,"txt":20}},"authorContributionVariance":{"oysterboi":17228.648},"authorDisplayNameMap":{"oysterboi":"CS2103T-T11-4 ONG ..HENG"}}
