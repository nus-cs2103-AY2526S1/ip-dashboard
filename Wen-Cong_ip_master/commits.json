This change allows for the creation of more specific task subclasses (such as Todo) by enforcing implementation through inheritance rather than direct instantiation.\n\nNow, Task serves as a blueprint for all task types with shared attributes (name, isDone) and behaviors, while preventing the creation of generic Task objects.
