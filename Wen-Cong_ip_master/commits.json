This change allows for the creation of more specific task subclasses (such as Todo) by enforcing implementation through inheritance rather than direct instantiation.\n\nNow, Task serves as a blueprint for all task types with shared attributes (name, isDone) and behaviors, while preventing the creation of generic Task objects. This improves code structure and extensibility as new task variants are added.\n","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":2,"deletions":2}}}]}]},"authorFileTypeContributionMap":{"Wen-Cong":{"java":220,"md":0,"fxml":0,"sh":0,"bat":1,"gradle":0,"txt":0}},"authorContributionVariance":{"Wen-Cong":3261.1428},"authorDisplayNameMap":{"Wen-Cong":"YEO ..CONG"}}
